# Music Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Music Recommendation System** using **Machine Learning** techniques. The system suggests songs, albums, and playlists based on user preferences and listening history, enhancing the music discovery experience.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends songs based on genres, artists, and metadata.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests music based on similar user preferences using **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**.
- **Hybrid Model:** Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies key factors influencing recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, SVD, Cosine Similarity)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd music-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset includes **song metadata, user listening history, and ratings**.
- Ensure the dataset is in **CSV format** with fields like **track_id, user_id, genre, artist, album, and ratings**.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to generate recommendations.
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Analyze recommendation accuracy.
3. **Make Recommendations**: Use the trained model to suggest songs based on user preferences.

To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```

## Results
- The system effectively recommends personalized music playlists.
- Hybrid filtering improves recommendation accuracy over standalone models.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** for improved personalization.
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time recommendations.
- Integrate with streaming platforms for better user insights.
